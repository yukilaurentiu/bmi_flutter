[BMI Calculator](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/learn/lecture/14485420#overview) from The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart, [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/learn/)


## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter.


## What you will create

We’re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
